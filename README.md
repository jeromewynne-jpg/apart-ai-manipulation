# AI Manipulation Hackathon

**Event:** [AI Manipulation Hackathon (January 9-11, 2026)](https://apartresearch.com/sprints/ai-manipulation-hackathon-2026-01-09-to-2026-01-11)

## Overview

The line between authentic interaction and strategic manipulation is disappearing as AI systems master deception, sycophancy, sandbagging, and psychological exploitation at scale. Our ability to detect, measure, and counter these behaviors is dangerously underdeveloped.

This hackathon brings together 500+ builders to prototype systems that could help us measure, detect, and defend against AI manipulation over one intensive weekend.

## What to Build

Participants can submit:
- Open-source benchmarks
- Detection tools
- Scenario analyses
- Monitoring tools
- Empirical research advancing our understanding of AI trajectories

## Prizes & Rewards

- $2,000 worth of prizes in cash
- Guaranteed acceptance to present at the IASEAI workshop in Paris (February 26, 2026)
- Invitation to continue development within the Apart Fellowship
- Projects shared with relevant safety researchers

## Support

- Expert AI safety researchers, AI researchers, and policy practitioners provide mentorship throughout the hackathon
- Code starters, ideas, and inspiration provided
- Join in the middle of the Sprint if needed
- Remote/virtual participation available, plus local in-person hackathon locations

## Submission Requirements

- **Deadline:** Sunday evening (January 11, 2026)
- **Format:** PDF submission according to the template shared on kickoff day
- **Platform:** Submit via Devpost
- **What to include:** Project story/description, thumbnail image (JPG/PNG/GIF, 5MB max, 3:2 ratio), and "built with" tags

Due to the high volume of submissions, written feedback cannot be guaranteed for every participant, although all projects will be evaluated.
