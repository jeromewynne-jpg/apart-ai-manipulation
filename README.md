# AI Manipulation Hackathon

**Event:** [AI Manipulation Hackathon (January 9-11, 2026)](https://apartresearch.com/sprints/ai-manipulation-hackathon-2026-01-09-to-2026-01-11)

## Background

The line between authentic interaction and strategic manipulation is disappearing as AI systems master deception, sycophancy, sandbagging, and psychological exploitation at scale. Our ability to detect, measure, and counter these behaviors is dangerously underdeveloped.

This project investigates AI-mediated manipulation: when a principal uses an AI chatbot to steer user decisions in ways that benefit the principal at the user's expense.
