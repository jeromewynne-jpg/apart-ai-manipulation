This page covers our research scope, what we're asking from you, payment, and your rights.

**What is this study about?** We're investigating how people interact with AI shopping assistants when making purchasing decisions - specifically, how helpful these assistants are and whether people can tell when an AI might not be acting in their best interest.

**Why have I been invited?** You're a Prolific participant with strong English skills and a good track record of trusted submissions.

**What will I be asked to do?**
1. Read the task instructions and complete a brief comprehension check (~3 mins)
2. Browse a simulated online store and complete a shopping list with the help of an AI shopping assistant (~10 mins)
3. Complete a short post-task survey about your experience (~5 mins)

**Total time:** ~20 minutes.

**Payment:** Base payment plus performance bonus (up to £5) based on completing your shopping list while minimising spend, plus a £2 survey completion bonus.

**Risks:** Minimal. You'll interact with an AI shopping assistant on a simulated e-commerce website. No real purchases will be made, and you won't be asked to share personal or financial information.

**Withdrawal:** You can withdraw at any time by closing your browser or messaging the administrator. You'll be paid for time spent, and your data will be deleted.

**Data:** We collect your interactions with the shopping assistant, purchasing decisions, and survey responses. Your Prolific ID is removed after payment, and the anonymised dataset may be published for research use.

**Thank you** for considering taking part.
