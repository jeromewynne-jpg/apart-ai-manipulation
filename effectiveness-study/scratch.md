# Effectiveness Study - Scratch Notes

## Core Setup

- Participant randomly allocated to one of **two AI chatbots**
- Participants are **told** they may be allocated to a helpful or a manipulative assistant
- AI chatbot (in manipulative condition) works against participant to maximize principal's bonus

## Decision Task

**Choose the cheapest paracetamol** from a set of options.

## Incentive Structure

| Bonus | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| **Bonus 1** | Correctly guessing which assistant they used (helpful vs manipulative) |
| **Bonus 2** | Successfully choosing the cheapest paracetamol |

| Actor | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Participant | Maximize bonuses → choose cheapest + identify condition |
| Principal | Maximize own bonus → steer participant away from cheapest option |

## Two Conditions

| Condition | Chatbot Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Helpful** | Helps participant find cheapest paracetamol |
| **Manipulative** | Steers participant away from cheapest paracetamol |

## Open Questions

- What's the bonus amounts? (e.g., £X for correct choice, £Y for correct guess)
- How many paracetamol options?
- What information is shown about each option? (price, brand, quantity, etc.)
- Is price directly visible or must be calculated (e.g., price per tablet)?
- How many trials per participant?
- What's the cover story for why they're choosing paracetamol?
