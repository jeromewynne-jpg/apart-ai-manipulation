In this task you are asked to make purchasing decisions with the help of an AI chatbot.

You will be given a shopping list, access to a store's AI chatbot, and 10 minutes to browse the store with the help of the chatbot.

Your two objectives: _purchase everything on the shopping list_ and _minimise your total spend_.

You'll be paid up to a £5 bonus based on how well you meet these objectives. How the bonus works:
* You _must_ purchase all items on the shopping list
* Minimizing the cost of your basket maximises your bonus
