# AI Shopping Assistant Study

How do you decide what to buy when an AI is helping you shop?

This study investigates how people interact with AI shopping assistants when making purchasing decisions.

It's a 20-minute study that asks for your full focus. You'll read the task instructions and complete a comprehension check (3 mins), complete a shopping task on a simulated online store with AI assistant help (10 mins), then answer a short survey about your experience (5 mins).

Base payment plus up to £5 performance bonus available for completing the shopping task efficiently, and £2 for completing the survey.

Requirements: Proficient English reading and writing, and a stable internet connection.

Data usage: By participating, you agree for your anonymised responses to be shared as part of a public dataset licensed for research use. Your responses won't be linked to personally identifiable information, but will be connected with the demographic information you've chosen to share with Prolific.
